   ```

## Usage

### Quick Start Commands

#### For OneDrive Migration Planning (260 character limit):
```powershell
.\WinPathScan.ps1 -Path "C:\Users" -Limit 260 -ExportFormat "Both"
```

#### For Teams File Sync (400 character limit):
```powershell
.\WinPathScan.ps1 -Path "C:\Users" -Limit 400 -ExportFormat "Both"
```

#### For Specific Directory:
```powershell
.\WinPathScan.ps1 -Path "C:\Documents" -Limit 260 -ExportFormat "HTML"
```

### Basic Usage Examples

```powershell
# Basic analysis with default settings
.\WinPathScan.ps1 -Path "C:\Users" -Limit 260

# Full analysis with HTML and CSV reports
.\WinPathScan.ps1 -Path "C:\Users" -Limit 260 -ExportFormat "Both"

# Include NTFS permissions analysis
.\WinPathScan.ps1 -Path "C:\Users" -Limit 260 -ExportFormat "Both" -IncludePermissions
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Path | Directory to analyze | (Required) |
| Limit | Maximum path length to flag | 400 |
| ExportFormat | Output format (HTML/CSV/Both) | HTML |
| IncludePermissions | Include NTFS permissions | False |

## Output

### What Happens When You Run the Tool

1. **Scanning**: The tool recursively scans the specified directory
2. **Analysis**: Identifies files/folders with paths longer than the specified limit
3. **Report Generation**: Creates timestamped folder with reports
4. **Console Output**: Shows summary statistics and progress
5. **Browser Launch**: Automatically opens HTML report in your default browser

### Generated Reports

The tool creates a timestamped folder (e.g., `Reports_20241218_143022`) containing:

#### HTML Report (`LongPathsReport.html`)
- Interactive tables with sorting and filtering
- Color-coded severity indicators
- Export buttons (Copy, Excel, CSV)
- Detailed statistics and summaries

#### CSV Report (`LongPathsReport.csv`)
- Raw data for further analysis in Excel or other tools
- All identified long paths with metadata
- Path remediation suggestions

#### Console Summary
- Total items processed
- Items exceeding the limit
- Access errors encountered
- Analysis duration

### Report Contents
- Total items exceeding limit
- Path length statistics
- Access errors encountered
- Remediation suggestions
- File creation/modification dates
- NTFS permissions (if requested)

## Common Use Cases

1. **OneDrive Migration Planning**
   - Identify paths that would break OneDrive sync
   - Get suggestions for path restructuring

2. **SharePoint Online Readiness**
   - Verify compatibility with SharePoint path limits
   - Export reports for migration planning

3. **Teams File Sync Preparation**
   - Ensure file paths will sync properly with Teams
   - Identify problematic folder structures

## Known Limitations

- Requires appropriate permissions to access scanned directories
- Some features require administrator privileges
- Performance may vary with large directory structures
- HTML report generation requires Edge, Chrome or FireFox or Safari or any modern Chromium based browser

## Best Practices

- Start with smaller directory structures to understand the output
- Use the `-IncludePermissions` switch only when necessary (impacts performance)
- Review both HTML and CSV reports for different insights
- Address longest paths first for maximum impact

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Module Installation Errors
```powershell
# If you get module installation errors, try:
Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -MinimumVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force
Install-Module -Name PSWriteHTML -Force -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
```

#### 2. Script Execution Policy Issues
```powershell
# If scripts are blocked, run:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

#### 3. Administrator Privileges Required
- **Error**: "Script requires administrator privileges"
- **Solution**: Run PowerShell as Administrator (Right-click ‚Üí "Run as administrator")

#### 4. Access Denied Errors
- **Error**: "UnauthorizedAccessException"
- **Solution**: This is normal for protected system folders. The tool will continue scanning accessible areas.

#### 5. Module Not Found
```powershell
# Verify PSWriteHTML is installed:
Get-Module -ListAvailable PSWriteHTML

# If not found, reinstall:
Install-Module -Name PSWriteHTML -Force -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
```

#### 6. "PowerShell script not found" Error
- **Error**: "ERROR: PowerShell script not found! Current directory: C:\Windows\System32"
- **Cause**: Batch files running from wrong directory (common when run with admin privileges)
- **Solution**: This has been fixed in version 1.1.1+ with automatic directory detection
- **Manual Fix**: Always navigate to the WinPathScan folder in Windows Explorer before double-clicking batch files

### Verification Checklist

Before running the tool, ensure:
- [ ] PowerShell 5.1+ is installed
- [ ] NuGet Package Provider is installed
- [ ] PSWriteHTML module is installed
- [ ] Running PowerShell as Administrator
- [ ] In the correct WinPathScan directory
- [ ] Execution policy allows script execution

### Performance Tips

- **Large Directories**: May take several minutes to scan
- **Network Paths**: Scan local paths first for better performance
- **Permissions**: Use `-IncludePermissions` only when necessary (slows down analysis)
- **Memory**: Large directory structures may require significant memory
